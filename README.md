# pdb_python_tools
Small tools for analyzing pdb files
The objective of this project is to set up a python script that reads in two pdb files and outputs the atoms/residues sorted by the Ã… they have been displaced. It will serve as a tool to diagnose structure modeling and make sure unexpected changes are not happening after a global refinement.
If time allows, I might add some other things that would be useful.

I am aware there might be available tools that do similar things, as well as libraries that do some of the things done here. This is a project for learning and some decisions are made with that aim in mind!

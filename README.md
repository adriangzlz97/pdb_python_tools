# pdb_python_tools
Small tools for analyzing pdb files
The objective of this project is to set up a python script that reads in two pdb files and outputs the atoms/residues sorted by the Ã… they have been displaced. It will serve as a tool to diagnose structure modeling and make sure unexpected changes are not happening after a global refinement.
If time allows, I might add some other things that would be useful.

I am aware there might be available tools that do similar things, as well as libraries that do some of the things done here. This is a project for learning and some decisions are made with that aim in mind!

# Requirements
Python3 and the modules sys, math, numpy (optional), mpi4py (optional)

## track_xyz.py usage
This script will find the maximum xyz coordinate change between two pdb files. The output will be a tabulated table sorted by the residues with the largest coordinate change.
For now, the files should be in pdb format and should be aligned first with some other program (e.g. ChimeraX)
### Non-mpi
python track_xyz.py *filename1 filename2* > output.txt
### Mpi
mpiexec -n <number of mpi processes> python track_xyz.py *filename1 filename2* > output.txt  
If you encounter an error about host, try:  
mpiexec -n <number of mpi processes> -host localhost python track_xyz_mpi.py *filename1 filename2* > output.txt
